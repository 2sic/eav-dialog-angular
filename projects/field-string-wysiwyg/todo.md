## TODO: SPM discuss

1. adam should be a sub-object with a normal type
1. icons come from a very different folder, but they are probably only for here - we should move them
1. languages - it seems that we both add resources from angular, and also tell tinymce to pick up files from elsewhere - not ideal
1. the main.ts has some todo-quick-fix notes on focus of tinymce
